# Nike X Goat Price Comparison

## Overview
This program consists of two main components: a web scraper (`NikeParser.py`) and a graphical user interface (GUI) application (`SneakerGUI.py`). The web scraper collects sneaker pricing information from the Nike website and compares it with resale prices on the GOAT website. The GUI allows users to input a Nike URL, run the scraper, and view the results in a sortable table. **The results will contain all sneakers such that a profit could be made from reselling (their resale price minus GOAT selling fees is greater than their retail price)**. 

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `selenium`
- `beautifulsoup4`
- `requests`
- `tkinter`
- `pandas`

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
2. Install the required Python libraries:
   ```bash
   pip install selenium beautifulsoup4 requests pandas
   ```
3. Ensure you have a compatible WebDriver for Selenium. Make sure it matches the version of your Chrome browser. Place it in your system PATH or the same directory as your script.

## Usage

### Running the Web Scraper
The web scraper (`NikeParser.py`) takes a Nike URL as an argument, scrapes the page for sneaker details, and compares the prices with those on the GOAT website. The results are saved to a CSV file.

### Sample Input
The Nike Best Selling Shoes page: https://www.nike.com/w/best-shoes-76m50zy7ok

#### Command Line
```bash
python NikeParser.py <Nike_URL>
```
Replace `<Nike_URL>` with the URL of the Nike page you want to scrape.

### Running the GUI
The GUI (`SneakerGUI.py`) allows users to input a Nike URL, run the scraper, and view the results.

#### Command Line
```bash
python SneakerGUI.py
```

### Using the GUI
1. Enter a Nike URL in the text box.
2. Click "Run Parser" to execute the scraper with the provided URL.
3. Once the scraping is complete, the data will be loaded and displayed in the table.
4. Click "Load CSV" to manually load the CSV file generated by the scraper.
5. Click on column headers to sort the data.
6. Click on any cell to copy its content to the clipboard.

## CSV Output
The results are saved in `NikeParserResults.csv` with the following columns:
- SKU
- Profit ($)
- Profit (%)
- Retail Price ($)
- Resale Price ($)
- Nike Link
- Goat Link

## Code Structure

### NikeParser.py
1. **URL Input**: Reads the URL from command-line arguments.
2. **Web Scraping**:
   - Uses `selenium` to open the Nike URL and scroll through the page to load all products.
   - Parses the page content with `BeautifulSoup` to extract product links.
   - Visits each product page to get price and SKU information.
3. **Price Comparison**:
   - Searches for each SKU on the GOAT website.
   - Compares retail and resale prices to calculate potential profit.
4. **CSV Output**: Writes the results to a CSV file.

### SneakerGUI.py
1. **GUI Setup**: Initializes the Tkinter window with widgets for URL input, buttons for running the parser and loading CSV, and a table for displaying data.
2. **Run Parser**: Runs `NikeParser.py` with the provided URL and loads the CSV results.
3. **Load CSV**: Loads and processes the CSV file to display in the table.
4. **Data Display**: Shows the data in a sortable table and allows copying cell content to the clipboard.

## Notes
- Ensure the Nike URL provided points to a valid product listing page.
- The scraper relies on the structure of the Nike and GOAT websites; changes to these websites may require updates to the scraper.
- Use responsibly and respect the terms of service of the websites being scraped.
